Description: The `modulr` package is a Dependency Injection (DI) Framework for R. By design, `modulr` allows to break down sequential programs into discrete, modular units that are loosely coupled, simple to develop, test, reuse and share in a wide range of situations. As every DI framework, it aims for a clear separation between code complication and complexity, highlighting the core purpose and behaviour of objects (application code), and hiding their construction and wiring (infrastructure code).
