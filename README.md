# Modulr: A Dependency Injection Framework for R

Modulr is a Dependency Injection (DI) framework for R which allows to break down sequential programs into discrete, modular units that are loosely coupled, simple to develop, test, debug, maintain, reuse, and share. 

* Modulr is designed to ease production of mocks for testing purpose and is therefore well-suited for [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).
* Modulr offers [docstrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring)-like comments for documenting the internals of a module.
* Modulr understands [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Sweave](https://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/), thanks to Yihui Xie's [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package.
* Modulr takes advantage of [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) to avoid _version lock_ and _version promiscuity_.
* Modulr can use [GitHub](http://github.com) (repositories and gists) to publish and share modules (so-called _gears_). See [`modulr/vault`](https://gist.github.com/aclemen1/3fcc508cb40ddac6c1e3) for an example.
* Modulr helps to circumvent errors occurring in a chain of nested dependent modules, showing [breadcrumbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_(navigation)).
* Modulr allows parallelization using [futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises), thanks to Henrik Bengtsson's [future](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future) package.
* Modulr implements __package isolation__ as an experimental feature: following the philosophy of Jim Hester's [withr](https://github.com/jimhester/withr) package, the 'with_' method `with_no_packages()` can be used to run code with temporarily no loaded or attached R packages.

Please read the [documentation](https://aclemen1.github.io/modulr) and vignettes (`browseVignettes(package = "modulr")`) to see extended examples in action.

## "Hello, world!"

devtools::install_github("hadley/devtools")
devtools::install_github("aclemen1/modulr")
```

If you encounter a clear bug, please [file a minimal reproducible example](https://github.com/aclemen1/modulr/issues).

## Real-world applications

![](https://github.com/aclemen1/modulr/raw/master/README-fig1.png)
Â   
This is the dependency graph of a module (on the rightmost side) which exposes tidy, exhaustive, statistics-ready, and daily HR data for the [University of Lausanne](http://www.unil.ch), Switzerland. Although not visible here, many of these modules are reused in other projects. The University of Lausanne has been running modulr in [mission critical applications](http://www.unil.ch/statistiques) since March 2015.
